#### User Documentation
Welcome, this userguide will give you a quick introduction to the Coding1Summative1 Program in Python.

### Begining.
To begin the program, double click on the file you wish to load. In this case, it is Summative 1.py.
Shown here.

### Name Entry
Once you begin the game, the program will introduce itself, and tell you the point of the game.
In this case, to answer 5 sums.
It will then prompt you for a same. This is taken as input and stored as a string

### Onwards!
The game will save your name, and refer to you throughout runtime by the name entered. This shows it can take input, store and recall. Here, we can see the example name 'Biffy' was used.
It will run a function in the background that generate 5 sums, and then tells the user it is doing so.
Once this is done, it will then outline the sums it wants the player to solve.

### Simple sum, for simple minds.
The game will then roll through its 5 different sums it has randomly generated. Behind the scenes, 2 numbers are generated, added together, and saved. This is then compared to the user input, a correct answer will increment the score, and incorrect will not.
Once the answer is checked the program will show a comment.

### Hubris!
When the user is incorrect, a 'humourous' message will display, and the user will move to the next question.
However, the score will NOT increase for them.

### Overcoming the ordeal
After all 5 questions have been answered, correctly or not. The game will come to an end. The program will give you a rating based on how many you have got correct. As you can see the score here is '4' as we got that second sum incorrect earlier.
This is checked by an if statement behind the scenes. (If X, DO this)
There is also hidden functionality for scoring '6', out of 5. But I will leave that for you to discover!
