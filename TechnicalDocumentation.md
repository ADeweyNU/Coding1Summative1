#Technical Documentation

This is the brief technical outline of my code. There will be snippets of code, analysis and explanation.

## Flowchart Example
Following here will be an example.
For a rough outline.
> Code begins. Takes and stores user name.

> Randomly generates the numbers for the sums, and adds them, saves them to a number ready to be compared to the user input.

> Prompts the user for input. Will then compare that to the generated number.

> If correct, increase score and print the congratstext. If not, print failtext.

>  Repeat through each sum.

> Compare score and print out the ending text.
