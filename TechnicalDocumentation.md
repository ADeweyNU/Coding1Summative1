# Technical Documentation

This is the brief technical outline of my code. There will be snippets of code, analysis and explanation.

## Flowchart Example
Following here will be an example.
For a rough outline.
> Code begins. Takes and stores user name.

> Randomly generates the numbers for the sums, and adds them, saves them to a number ready to be compared to the user input.

> Prompts the user for input. Will then compare that to the generated number.

> If correct, increase score and print the congratstext. If not, print failtext.

>  Repeat through each sum.

> Compare score and print out the ending text.

## Begining
At the start, I begin with a comment. This is an easy way to display the name of the file, and why it has been created. TO ceate a comment in Python, the # is used.
After this, are the imports, taking from other distinguished libraries to use certain functions. This one is 'random'. I will need it so that I can generate my random functions. This will be used to generate the number to add together.
Finally, after that I use #region, which can be closed with #endregion. This allows you to et diffeent regions of the code and name them. THey cna be closed and minimised to save space.
