### Summative Assessment 1: Set Programming Exercises
Created in Python 3.12


### What the project does
This is a simple interactive maths quiz presented to the user through the console. It will open to a black screen, with takes user input via keyboard.
It will randomly generate some questions, and then ask the user to solve them. The user assigns themselves a name and then will input numbers to solve these.
At the end the user will be marked, and the program completes, and then waits for input to close, allowing the user to view their grade.

###Project Features
It will begin, take user input and store it, print this, then random generate some numbers. It will add them and store that, then prompt the user for input. It will compare these, increasing a score if correct, and outputting text. Once all are completed it will output a comment based on the score.

### Why the project is useful
This was a quick introduction to Python. It was created to test various functions and knowledge. It contains ints, input, output, functions, sums and comparisons. It is a simple way to demonstrate learning and knowledge of these functions and Python.

The functions are designed to be pure, meaning:
>They have side effects, changing nothing outside of themselves.

>Same inputs, get the same output. An int goes in, int comes out.

>No external dependencies. The function exists ‘as-is’ and no external data is needed.

Where possible these have been kept, however, as some numbers are randomly generated, and thus output is ‘different’ each time, it could be argued these are impure.

### System Requirements
This program was created in Visual Code and runs through the console. It is a small program and doesn’t require much overhead or system requirements. There is no need for extra libraries or software.

### How users can get started with the project
To get started the user will need to download the repository. After clicking on the file named ‘Summative1’. The program will begin and can be interacted with through the terminal.

### Longer term goals

>If there has been more time I would have liked to have output of the score and names to a file. This could be used as a ‘high score’ table of sorts. This could be done by open, write and close.

>Colours. I would have liked the username, and the different scores to be output in different colour. Perhaps also for correct and incorrect. This might invoice ANSI or new libraries.

### Where users can get help with your project
If any help or information is required. I can be reached on here. Or via my Uni email.

### Who maintains and contributes to the project
This product is created, and maintained by me. I have used C# before and this is my first time using Python.
